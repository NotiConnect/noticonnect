==========

## Introduction
    NotiConnect is a background accessibility service that forwards relevant information of notifications sent by apps of the user's choosing. The information is sent to the NotiConnect server where the data can be accessed via our web UI or RESTful API. This application is part of our term project for the Android Developer (CIS298) class at Kalamazoo Valley Community College. The idea behind this application is to ultimately use IoT networking concepts to help synchronize important notifications across devices.
